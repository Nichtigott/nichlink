//! The one sentence a bounded answer ends with, and the one place that spells it.
//! 一条有上限的答案结尾会带着的那一句话，以及拼出它的唯一地方。
//!
//! An answer that withholds rows has to say three things at once — how many it
//! withheld, which cap did it, and how to reach the rest — and every tool here used
//! to say them its own way: `… +2 more definitions`, `… +5 more`, `… truncated: 501
//! lines total, 400 shown.` Three shapes for one fact is how a reader learns to
//! skip them, and a skipped truncation notice makes a partial answer read as a whole
//! one. The sentence lives here so the wording cannot drift between tools, and the
//! phrase's uniqueness is pinned by `truncation_tests`.
//! 一条扣下了行的答案必须一次说清三件事——扣下多少、哪道上限扣的、怎么拿到其余部分——而这里每个
//! 工具过去都用自己的说法：`… +2 more definitions`、`… +5 more`、`… truncated: 501 lines
//! total, 400 shown.` 同一个事实有三种词形，正是读者学会跳过它们的方式，而被跳过的截断说明会让
//! 一个残缺的答案读起来像完整的。这句话住在这里，好让措辞不会在工具之间漂移；而它的唯一性由
//! `truncation_tests` 钉住。

/// rest. Every site that knows its own counts uses this; a site that stopped
/// computing before it could count uses [`withheld_uncounted`].
/// `omitted` 与 `total` 是行数——形状是 `omitted of total`，读者因此既看得见缺了多少、也看得见
