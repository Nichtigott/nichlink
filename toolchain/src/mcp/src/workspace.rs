//! What the configured root is, and the merged answer a virtual manifest needs.
//! 配置的根是什么，以及虚拟清单所需要的合并答案。
//!
//! Every identity in this bridge is hashed over `(namespace, source path, declared
//! name)`, and the namespace is the *package's own name* — that is the design, not a
//! coincidence: the declaration macros read `crate::NICHLINK_NAMESPACE`, which `host!()` defines from the package name, so
//! "package = namespace" is exactly what a built host compiled. A workspace root is
//! not a package, so it has no namespace of its own, and every tree tool used to
//! refuse there with Cargo's own words. The machine was there; the entrance was not.
//! 本桥里的每个身份都是对 `(命名空间, 源码路径, 声明名)` 取散列，而命名空间就是**包自己的名字**
//! ——这是设计而不是巧合：声明宏读的是 `crate::NICHLINK_NAMESPACE`，而 `host!()` 用包名定义它，因此"包 = 命名空间"恰恰
//! 就是已构建宿主编译出的那一个。工作区根不是一个包，因此它没有自己的命名空间，而每个树级工具过去
//! 都在那里用 Cargo 自己的话拒绝。机器在，入口不在。
//!
//! This module is that entrance. When the root is a virtual manifest, `cargo metadata`
//! enumerates the members, and each one is read **from its own published records
//! first** (`<member>/target/nichlink/out`, through `build_method`'s readers — see
//! `published.rs`). Deriving a member's faces is the *fallback*, taken only when it
//! published nothing, because deriving every member is what made a workspace answer
//! cost the sum of every member's source walk. The merged view groups by package,
//! and **every member appears with its status**: `published` (its own records, with
//! freshness), `not built` (no records, so the tree below was derived now and says
//! so), `no faces` (the record — or the derived tree — declares none, and saying so
//! is the answer), or `unresolvable` (with the reason). Neither silence nor a
//! whole-answer error is an answer: a framework member must not be dressed up as an
//! empty tree, and a nested package Cargo cannot resolve must say why rather than
//! vanish.
//! 本模块就是那个入口。根是虚拟清单时，`cargo metadata` 枚举成员，而每个成员**先按它自己已发布的
//! 记录**读取（`<member>/target/nichlink/out`，经 `build_method` 的读取器——见 `published.rs`）。
//! 推导一个成员的面是**回落**路径，只在它什么都没发布时才走，因为逐成员推导正是让一份工作区答案
//! 等于每个成员源码遍历之和的原因。合并视图按包分组，而且**每个成员都带着它的状态出现**：
//! `published`（它自己的记录，带新鲜度）、`not built`（没有记录，因此下面的树是现推的，并且会说出来）、
//! `no faces`（记录——或推导出的树——不声明任何面，说出来就是答案）、或 `unresolvable`（带上原因）。
//! 沉默与整条报错都不是答案：框架成员不许被装扮成一棵空树，Cargo 解析不了的嵌套包必须说出原因而不是消失。
//!
//! The override still names one tree. `NICH_LINK_NAMESPACE` wins before Cargo is asked,
//! so with it set a virtual root is read as the package that name denotes — the one case
//! where a caller can give a workspace root an identity by hand.
//! 覆盖仍然只命名一棵树。`NICH_LINK_NAMESPACE` 在询问 Cargo 之前胜出，因此设置它之后，虚拟根会被
//! 读作那个名字所指的包——这是调用方唯一能手工给工作区根一个身份的情形。
//!
//! online: a virtual root merges members whose records may be absent, stale or newer than the build, and the merged answer has to say which each member was.
